### Customizations in This README:
- **Project Title**: "Data Science Tools and Ecosystem"
- **Description**: Describes the introduction and purpose of the project, which is to familiarize yourself with the data science ecosystem.
- **Installation Instructions**: Steps to set up the project locally, including creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies.
- **Contributing**: Since this is a course assignment, I've included a general guideline on contributing, but contributions aren't necessary unless you want to improve the repository.
- **License**: Since this is a course assignment, it doesn't require a formal license, but you can modify it to be educational use.

If you need further adjustments or have specific tools, libraries, or steps to add, feel free to let me know!
